imperative.

Tools are also important:

[quote, Dianne Marsh, director of engineering for engineering tools at Netflix.]
____
We want to make sure that all the engineers at Netflix are able
to work as fast and as responsibly fast as they want to work.
If we don’t give them enough context about what they’re
deploying or about what’s going on in the ecosystem at large
then they could cause big problems in the service.
They could cause disruptions in the service.

=== RED HAT 3SCALE API MANAGEMENT

API why so important ?

3scale Overview

Features:

image::docs/images/3scalefeatures.png[3scale Features]

Features:

* Scalability and Uptime

The API management platform you choose shouldn’t be a bottleneck or a single point of failure. It must provide caching,
fault tolerance, traffic routing, and load balancing.
3scale is designed to scale to billions of API calls

* Developer Portal

A developer portal is key to ensuring a positive experience for developers. To keep them engaged, provide the tools they need to get started in minutes
with use cases, example code, documentation, and pricing.


* API Access Control and Security

3scale’s powerful API access, policy and traffic controls make it
simple to authenticate traffic, restrict by policy, protect backend services, impose rate limits and create access tiers. Provide sophisticated support for authentication with API keys, OIDC tokens or custom configs. Classify different types of users and provide a variety of business services. Application plans help control what can be done with your API. Rate limits allow you to manage and control flow.


* Analytics

You need insight into how your APIs are performing:
access to trends, peak usage times, which applications generate the most traffic, which APIs are most popular, and which APIs or endpoints are used the least.


* Monetization

APIs can enable whole new revenue streams so the ability
to set pricing rules, invoicing, and payment collection is critical.
