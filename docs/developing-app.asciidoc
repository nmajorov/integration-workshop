=== Developing API

API First approach

An API-first approach means that for any given development project,
your APIs are treated as “first-class citizens.” That everything about a project revolves around
the idea that the end product will be consumed by mobile devices, and that APIs will be consumed by client applications.

The Benefits of an API-First Approach:

* Development teams can work in parallel

* Ensures good developer experiences

* Reduces the risk of failure

Steps to develop API:
